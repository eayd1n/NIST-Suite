//! This module performs the Frequency Monobit Test.
//! If this test does not pass, the remaining tests are NOT executed (makes sense, right?)
//!
//! Description of test from NIST SP 800-22:
//!
//! "The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test
//! is to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would
//! be expected for a truly random sequence. The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1⁄2, that
//! is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests depend on
//! the passing of this test."
